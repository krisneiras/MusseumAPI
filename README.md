- ### Step 2️⃣ Create and connect your DataBase

In this project we created our DB with mysql, so you will have to create your database and call it sculptures and another one for the tests called sculptures_test.

In the files you will see an .env_example, you rename it to .env and enter your real information:

DB_DEV_NAME=  
DB_USER=  
DB_PASSWORD=  
DB_PORT=  
DB_TEST_NAME=  

- ### Step 3️⃣ Run the server 🚀🚀

Write this command on your terminal:
```bash
npm run dev 
```
- ### Step 4️⃣ Try all requests with Postman
